* 🌲 Organized Nix Flakes? 

I manage my whole system with single org file. Its easy and pretty handy. You can read that file here *↬* [[file:d-setup.org][d-setup.org]] , its both self documenting and has all source code blocks.

Another key feature in my setup is, every file i tangle is at *read-only mode* (#o444). So generally we can avoid editing/touching them. Thus, every action has to be made in *d-setup.org* only.

Also, I have made some config (/hyprland,emacs../) files to be *symlink*, so i can edit them without requiring to rebuild whole thing!

#+begin_center
| *Note*: Check pre-requisites heading in setup file ([[file:d-setup.org][d-setup]]) to add your username and hostname there.                            |
| I have tried to comment few things to make it as a info, you can _ask/create issue_ regarding this, don't hold back.   *I'm waiting for you to ask!*      |

** 📑 Installation Guide
If you are beginner, I'd recommend you to play with it in VM.

1. Partition the disk as you require (edit file system section in configuration.nix)

2. Run command to generate hardware-configuration.nix which will be created at /mnt/etc/nixos

         #+begin_src shell
           sudo nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
      #+end_src

3. Then git clone this repo and remove flake.lock and update channels

      #+begin_src shell
        # Install git first
        nix-env -iA nixos.git

        git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/idlip/d-nix SETUP
        cd SETUP
        rm flake.lock

        # Update nix channels
        nix flake update
      #+end_src

4. Do rebuild of flake system.

      #+begin_src shell
        sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
      #+end_src

Before that I believe you are a tinkerer, I have a motto which goes like this


#+begin_quote
/If you want to understand the whole, Understand its parts/. *[[https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-gestalt-psychology-2795808][Gestalt Psychology]]*
#+end_quote

  
I mean, that is how *Nix Philosophy or Linux users are, We understand each utility (grep, sed...) and make precise use of it, You can technically call it Magic of scripting.

*** 🎖️ Credits 

These configs were the inspiration and helped to build this way.

I thank them sincerely.

[[https://github.com/Iron-Shark/Technonomicon][Iron Shark]] *⟹* Made migrating to Single org-file config very easy.

[[https://github.com/sioodmy/dotfiles][Sioodmy]] *⟹* First config which I understand thoroughly and modified based on this.
