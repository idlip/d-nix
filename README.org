* Organized Nix Flakes? 🌲

I manage my whole system with single org file. Its easy and pretty handy. You can read that file here *↬* [[file:d-setup.org][d-setup.org]] , its both self documenting and has all source code blocks.

Another key feature in my setup is, every file i tangle in at *read-only mode*. So generally we can avoid editing/touching them. Thus, every action has to be made in *d-setup.org* only.

Also, I have made files to be *symlink*, so i can edit them without requiring to rebuild whole thing!

** Welcome to 'Will of D' flakes system 

*** Now if you get doubt of, "Should I try NixOS?" 

Here is an answer from a non-programmer, who just browse and watches media.
Just don't, if you are looking for small benefit. Don't!
You will regret having hard time to figure out petty things, again forget about error, you cannot even search in web.

But, if you have decided, go with it. According to me (non-programmer), these points are good to consider NixOS
 + You use Emacs (lol), *Emacs* ❤️  *Nix* is Match made in Heaven.
 + You want to declare stuffs and get same output, and forget what all you setup, cause its all declared in config.
 + You want an isolated environments (shell) to do some stuffs without involving whole system.
 + You want to stop troubleshooting and breaking update and are lazy to backup, and want to rollback with ease like with just a reboot.
 + You want to say Nix  Btw.


** Pack your bags, lets go through our configuration! 🕶️
Before that I believe you are a tinkerer, I have a motto which goes like this
+ /If you want to understand the whole, Understand its parts/. *[[https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-gestalt-psychology-2795808][Gestalt Psychology]]*
  
  I mean, that is how *Nix Philosophy or Linux users are, We understand each utility (grep, sed...) and make precise use of it, You can technically call it Magic of scripting.


**** Credits 🎖️

These configs were the inspiration and helped to build this way.

I thank them sincerely.

[[https://github.com/Iron-Shark/Technonomicon][Iron Shark]] *⟹* Made migrating to Single org-file config very easy.

[[https://github.com/sioodmy/dotfiles][Sioodmy]] *⟹* First config which I understand thoroughly and modified based on this.
